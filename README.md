# Because CRA is not working well and

- whenever I try to compile components, it gives me a lot of waiting term. It was really weird
- so, I determined making CRA default setting from scratch
- I though there could be something problems when I use it,

- but, at least, weird webpack dev server compilation error is gone now.

- I'm happy and I'm gonna make youtube clone with this setting.
